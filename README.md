Data is more powerful when we share it with others!

This repository contains all of the html files and the resources for my very first github
hosted website. It contains some data, graphs, and analysis of weather elements in random 
cities across the globe. The pandas code to create some of the graphs is visible in my python-api-challenge repository

The websites homepage is visible [here](https://henrypoe.github.io/web-design-challenge/)
